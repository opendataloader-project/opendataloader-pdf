# Sync documentation to homepage repository on release
#
# Required Setup:
# 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with minimal scope:
#    - 'contents: write' permission ONLY for opendataloader.org repository
#    - Use fine-grained PAT if possible for better security
# 2. Add the token as a repository secret named 'HOMEPAGE_SYNC_TOKEN'
#    Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret
# 3. The token owner must have write access to opendataloader.org repository
#
# Testing: This workflow only runs on published releases.
# To test manually, create a pre-release or use workflow_dispatch.
#
# Security: Third-party action is pinned to a specific SHA for integrity.
