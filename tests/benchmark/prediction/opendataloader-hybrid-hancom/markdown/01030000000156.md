Fact-Checking

In-this
context, we are
talking about
fact-checking
thatis done
before a source
is published.
Over the last
two decades
there has been
an increase in
factchecking as
an activity that
takes place after
a source has
been published,
apractice
discussed in
more detail in
the chapter,
SIFTing
Information.

Fact checkers verify that the names,
dates, and facts in a work (usually an
article or book) are correct. For
example, they may contact a person
who is quoted in a proposed news
article and ask the person whether
this quotation is correct, or how to
spell the person's name. Fact-
checkers are primarily useful in
catching accidental mistakes.

The number of people employed in
fact-checking varies by publication.
Some organizations have substantial
fact-checking departments. Others
may hire freelancers per piece, or
may combine fact-checking with
other duties. Magazines are more
likely to use fact checkers than
newspapers. Television and radio
programs rarely employ dedicated
fact checkers, and instead expect
others, including senior staff, to
engage in fact-checkingin additionto
their other duties.
