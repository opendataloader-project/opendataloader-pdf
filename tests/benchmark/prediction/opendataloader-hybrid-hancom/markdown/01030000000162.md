Possible directions for the discussion:

What the sources suggest about the level of
research. Do sources like Wikipedia and Pinterest
indicate a deep engagement with the topic? What
about the Encyclopedia of Propaganda? Call back to
the chapter, Identifying a Topic, encyclopedias are
good preliminary sources, but if research stops with
an overview source, how valuable isit?

Ways in which the citations are ambiguous. Is
enough information provided that readers can find
the original information? Is number about that
person or written by that person? Is number 4 a book
or an article? It-has implications for how we would
look forit. For number 5, there is more than one
book with the title Encyclopedia of Propaganda,and
also it's unlikely they meant to refer to the whole
encyclopedia.

The difference between discovering source on a
social media platform and citing the content. Is
enough information given to find the Pinterest
source? Revisit the creator concept from the chapter,
Types of Sources. Social media companies distribute
but do not create content, SO they are not the ones
that should be cited. Opportunity to talk about
specific sources students have found on social media
