# Stop

In these
chapters we're
focusing on
researchinga
wicked problem,
but the SIFT
method isaa
great thingto
use beforeyou
share
information on
social media.
Often we feel
compelled to
share the things
that evoke the
strongest
feelings, but
those strong
feelings are a
good sign that
those things
need to be
checked before
they are shared.

Check your emotions. If a claim
causes strong emotion anger, glee,
pride, vindication STOP. You must
fact-check this claim. Remember
from the chapter, Our Mental
Shortcuts, that we more readily
accept information that confirms our
beliefs (confirmation bias) and we
tend to think less critically about that
kind ofinformation than we do about
information that challenges our
beliefs (motivated reasoning.) A
strong emotional reaction is a sign
that these cognitive biases are at
work. Remember, these mental
shortcuts don't make us bad people,
we all have them. But we do need to
account for them ifwe want to move
toward better information.

In addition, if you get lost while
working on the other moves, or hit
dead ends, or find yourself going
down an increasingly confusing
rabbit hole during your investigation,
STOP. Back up and start over knowing
what you know now. You're likely to
take a more informed path with
different search terms and better decisions.
