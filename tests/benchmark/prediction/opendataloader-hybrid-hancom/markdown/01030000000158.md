# Introduction

Throughout the chapters, I tried to generate Reflection &
Discussion Questions that could be used either as in class (whole
group or think/pair/share) discussion prompts or as written
reflections assigned out of class. If your students generate any
written answers to any of the Reflection & Discussion Questions in
this chapter, would be very interested to see them.

# Our Mental Shortcuts

If you'd like to reinforce Kahneman's ideas about System 1 and
System 2 thinking the video below (12 minutes) is very good, (thanks
to Mike Davidson for this suggestion.)
