# Nonlinear equations

# 4.1 Introduction

The pressure drop in a fluid in motion is examined. For a flow in a pipe with a circular cross
section of diameter D (meter), the Reynolds number, Re,isgivenby

inwhichv (m/s) is the average flow velocity andv (m2/s) is the viscosity of the fluid. The flowis
called laminar if Re < 2100 (low flow velocity) and turbulent if Re > 3000. For 2100 <Ree <3000,
the flow isneither laminar nor turbulent.

For turbulent flows, the pressure drop between inflow and outflow is given by

in which W isa friction coefficient, (kg/ms) is the fluid density, L (m) is the length andg (m/s2)
is the acceleration of gravity. If the fluid contains particles (sand, paper fibers), then the friction
coefficient W satisfies the equation

in which kis a parameter known from experiments.

In this chapter, numerical methods will be discussed that can be used to determine wif the values
of Re and k are known.

# 4.2 Definitions

In this chapter, various iterative methods will be considered to solve nonlinear equations of the
formf(p) = 0. The point pis called a zero of the functionf, or a root of the equation_(r) = 0.
First, some useful definitions and concepts are introduced.

# Convergence

Each numerical method generates a sequence [Pn] po.p1.p2.·.· which should converge to p:
limn->00 Pn = p. Assume that the sequence indeed converges, with Pn ≠ p for alln. If there exist
positive constants 入 and a satisfying
