Figure This image shows the Western hemisphere as viewed
from space 35,400 kilometers (about 22,000 miles) above Earth.
Data about the land surface from one satellite was combined with
another satellite's data about the clouds to create the image.

Our nearest astronomical neighbor is Earth's satellite, commonly
called the Moon. Figure22 shows Earth and the Moon drawn to scale
on the same diagram. Notice how small we have to make these
bodies to fit them on the page with the right scale. The Moon's
distance from Earth is about 30 times Earth's diameter, or
approximately 384,000 kilometers, and it takes about a month for
the Moon to revolve around Earth. The Moon's diameter is 3476
kilometers, about one fourth the size ofEarth.
