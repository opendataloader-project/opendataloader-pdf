the jet velocity can be assumed to remain constant. Therefore, the horizontal distance traveled by jet
(x) in time (t) is equal to:

The vertical component of the trajectory of the jet will have a constant acceleration downward due to
the force of gravity. Therefore, at any time, t, the y-position of the jet may be calculated as:

Rearranging Equation (8) gives:

Substitution of and V from Equations 9 and 2 into Equation 7 results in:

Equations (10) can be rearranged to find Cv:

Therefore, for steady flow conditions (i.e., constant h in the head tank), the value of Cv can be
determined from the x,y coordinates of the jet trajectory. A graph of X plotted against Vyh will have
aslope of 2Cv.

IfCais assumed to be constant, then a graph ofQ plotted against ✓h (Equation 6) will be linear, and
the slope of this graph will be:
