# 7. THEORY

Two types of vortices are distinguished in the dynamics of the motion: forced and free vortices. The
forced vortex is caused by external forces on the fluid, such as the impeller of a pump, and the free
vortex naturally occurs in the flow and can be observed in a drain or in the atmosphere ofa tornado.

# 7.1. FREE VORTEX

A free vortex is formed when water flows out ofa vessel through a central hole in the base (Figure 8.2).
The degree of the rotation depends on the initial disturbance. In a free cylindrical vortex, the velocity
varies inversely with the distance from the axis of rotation (Figure 8.3).

The equation governing the surface profile is derived from the Bernoulli's theorem:

Substituting Equation (1) into (2) will give a new expression:
