Note that the exact error equals

M-Q(h) =e-2.7525. ..=-0.0342

In this example the error estimate is very reliable.
To receivea better approximation the error estimate can be added to the approximation:

Q(h) +cphp 2.7525 0.0348 2.7177

In the above example, the value ofp was computed using Richardson's extrapolation. However,
using Theorem 3.2.1, itis clear that p 1,and this value could have been used immediately in
equation (3.13b) in order to determine Cphp. In practice, more complex situations are found,and
the following complications may occur:

Itis not known whether higher-order derivatives exist and /or are bounded.

The final result is a combination of various approximation methods. The influence of these
approximations on pis not always clear.

During implementation of the algorithm in a computer program, errors may be made.

To reveal any of these complications itis good practice to verify whether the calculated pis close
to the p that follows from theory.

# 3.7.3 Formulae of higher accuracy from Richardson's extrapolation

In several applications the value of p in (3.10) is known. In that case Richardson's extrapolation
can be used to determine formulae of higher accuracy.

This is done by making use of the fact that the error estimates for Q(h) and Q(2h) equal

Multiplying equation (3.15a) by2P and subtracting equation (3.15b) from this yields

(3.15a)
(3.15b)

such that

This means that

(3.16)

The value (2PQ(h) Q(2h))/(2P is a new approximation formula for M with an accuracy
that is one order higher than the orderof Q(h).

# Example 3.7.2 (Forward difference of higher accuracy)

As an example, the forward-difference method is considered. The errorin the forward-difference
formula may be written as

(3.17)

and the difference for 2h equals

f'(x)-Qj(2h) =c22h+0(7).
