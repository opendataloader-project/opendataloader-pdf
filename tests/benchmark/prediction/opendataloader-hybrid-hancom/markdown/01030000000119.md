chromosome. Meiosis and mitosis are both nuclear divisions

that result in new daughter cells. However, the two processes have significant
differences. Fill out the following chart comparing the two forms of nuclear division.

Mitosis

(begins with a single cell)

Meiosis

- 5. Using your beads, strings, and magnets recreate the process of meiosis. Ensuring you
have two different colored beads, demonstrate the process of crossing over. When you
think you have it down, flag your instructor over. Have them sign off on your handiwork.

- 6. By now hopefully you've noticed that these processes are denoted with "2n" and "n" in
various places. This is a reference to the number of sets of chromosomes that cell has at
any given moment. Autosomal human cells are 2n. Gametes are 1n. Mitosis begins with
one 2n cell and ends with two 2n cells. Meiosis begins with one 2n cell and ends with 4 1n
cells. Sketch those two processes here to show every time the "n" classification changes.
(Hint: draw every step, it'll make your life easier, evenif it takes a little bit longer!)
