What's unique about the growth of Alligator Gars is their fast growth in the first years of life followed by slower
growth (Figure 8.6; Figure 8.7). Juvenile Alligator Gars quickly transition to fish-eating habits (Butler etal. 2018).
A fish diet means the juveniles grow at 4-5 mm per day in the first three months of life, SO that by the end of the
first growing season they may reach 1.5 to 2 feet in length (~40-70 cm) and 8-10 pounds in weight (Sakaris etal.
2019). Despite their fast growth, young Alligator Gars are preyed upon by many larger fish.
