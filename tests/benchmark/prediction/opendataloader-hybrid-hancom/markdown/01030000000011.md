knowledge about remote civilizations. There is an
obviousculturalcoincidence,forinstance,between
carpet-making and storytelling among nomadic
peoples, which these stories convey through their
intricate plot development. They also tell fascinat-
ing stories about the the traffic in diamonds, gold,
and spices between the Indies, China,Arabia, and
Western Europe thatstill waittobeunveiled. Rather
than looking the things of the Nights as colorful
details in Sheherazade's tales or protagonists in the
fantasticstories they makeforthemselves, wecould
explore, instead, their role as as bearers of cultural
knowledge unintentionally embedded in the fabric
ofthe text. In suchareading, "historically and theo-
retically overdetermined material charactersitics
of objects are sought out beyond the immediate
context in which they appear"ss in order to

defetishize them and expose the power structures
inwhich they are involved.

Thus, as Makdisi and Nussbaum sum up in their
introduction to The Arabian Nights in Historical
Context: Between East and West, "the Nights offered
particularly powerful vision ofan Asiatic culture
seemingly saturated with references to sensuality,
extravagance, indulgence, violence, supernatural-
ism, and eroticism [and] added a supernatural
dimension to the Enlightenment; the tales offered
an avenue into modernity through its magical op-
posite, an alternative to European identity, and an
antidote to neoclassicism: "87 However, reading
such imports as an expression of European pow-
ers' disavowal of the East in order to "justify their
conquest and rule over other peoples, particularly
inAsia,"ss is an oversimplification ofa rather com-
plicated process of cultural exchange. None of
these descriptions of Arabia were caused by colo-
nial "distortions," as Said feared, but by false attri-
butions: "Arabian" was a misnomer that rarely de-
scribed Arabia itself. While fictional narratives like
Arabian Nights' Entertainments represented Ara-
bia as a land of magic and exorbitant riches, they
were too far-fetched to be part of a Westerner's
belief system during the Age of Reason; rather,
they were popularized because their wild fiction-
ality turned them into bestsellers at the time. Such
stories competed with descriptions of the Arabi-
an Peninsula by travelers and traders who had vis-
ited the area and had unmediated contact with the
local culture. However, while the Orientalist litera-
ture described Arabia in terms that emphasized
its exoticism, magic, superstitions, extravagance,
wealth, eroticism, excess, and myriads of otherpe-
culiarities that contrasted it with the European
normativity, travel narratives created an "Arabian"
identity that was generally congruent with the
reality of theplace.
