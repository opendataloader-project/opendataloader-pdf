# 1. Shipping as a vector for  marine IAS

# List of Philippine Ports is in Appendix 3

Shipping remains as the only scientifically documented pathway for marine biological invasion in the Philippines with the    introduction  and  invasion  of  the South American mussel Mytella strigata (Vallejo et al. 2017). This invasive was first recorded from the South Harbor of Manila  in  2014  and  has  been  known  to have  spread  throughout  Manila  Bay,  to Lingayen Gulf, Aparri, Cagayan and Batangas  Port  in  the  Philippines.  It  has since then reported in Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, the Gulf of Thailand, and Sri Lanka.

Mytella was likely spread through hull fouling and ballast water release. In the Philippines its spread to other ports was likely through small vessel hull fouling as the first adult samples were recorded from the fishing boat FV Ocean in 2015 which was docked in Manila Bay. An intensive monitoring  of  the  South  Harbor  area  in  2014  resulted  in  the  detection  of  the  first  cohort  of recruits in Manila Bay. The likely first introduction by ballast water release or by biofouling was in December 2013 and the first cohort of recruits was detected in July 2014.

There are at least 15 marine non-indigenous species ship hull fouling recorded from Manila Bay's South Harbor (Vallejo et al. 2019; Trinidad et al 2017.) Only Mytella is considered invasive enough to have wide scale ecological and economic impacts.  The most numerous species is the wellstudied Hydroides elegans , which is a known ship fouler with a present pantropical distribution.
