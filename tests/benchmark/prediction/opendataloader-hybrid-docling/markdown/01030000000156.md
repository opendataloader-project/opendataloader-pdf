# Fact-Checking 2

In this context, we are talking about fact-checking that is done before a source is published. Over the last two decades there has been an increase in fact checking as an activity that takes place after a source has been published, a practice discussed in more detail in the chapter, SIFTing Information.

Fact checkers verify that the names, dates, and facts in a work (usually an article or book) are correct. For example, they may contact a person who  is  quoted  in  a  proposed  news article  and  ask  the  person  whether this  quotation  is  correct,  or  how  to spell the person's name. Factcheckers are primarily useful in catching accidental mistakes.

The number of people employed in fact-checking  varies  by  publication. Some organizations  have  substantial fact-checking departments. Others may  hire  freelancers  per  piece,  or may combine fact-checking with other  duties.  Magazines  are  more likely to use fact checkers than newspapers. Television and radio programs  rarely employ  dedicated fact checkers, and instead expect others, including senior staff, to engage in fact-checking in addition to their other duties.
