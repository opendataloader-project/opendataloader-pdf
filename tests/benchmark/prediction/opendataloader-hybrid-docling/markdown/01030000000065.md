# 5. Natural dispersal

Dispersal by purely natural means is not included as a pathway of biological invasions (Gaston 1996). Examples include range expansion by flight or any other medium of natural locomotion or transport. However if human created or crafted material is involved in rafting dispersal of IAS, then  this  may  be  considered  as  a  case  of  biological  invasion.    The  2011  Great  East  Japan earthquake generated a large tsunami that caused an unprecedented biological transoceanic rafting event from the northwestern Pacific coastline of Japan towards North America on the eastern Pacific(Carlton et al. 2017). Millions of human made objects from small plastics to large docks  and  whole  ships  were  cast  adrift  in  the  Pacific  (Murray  et  al.  2018).  This  provided  a substrate  for  biofoulers.  Large  debris  could  carry  up  to  20  to  30  mega-species  of  biofoulers (Carlton et al. 2017). These biofouled debris can constitute an IAS risk (Therriault 2017).

While a tsunami is a relatively rare event, a more common one is fouler dispersal by rafting on coastal currents of floating plastic debris, wood and, bamboo.  Marine litter often originate from
