# 3. Perspective of supply and demand balance of wood pellets and cost structure in Japan

According to a survey taken by the Japan Woody Bioenergy Association in FY2018 (from April 2018 to March 2019) with 55 biomass power generators, more than half of fuel for biomass power generation is domestically produced wood biomass at present in Japan in terms of weight (Figure 4.5).

When translating the survey result into energy form, it is estimated that, within biomass power  generation  using wood  biomass  ('Unutilised wood', 'General  wood', and 'Construction  wood  waste'),  around  30%  of  input  fuel  is  met  by  import  biomass  fuel (Figure 4.6).
