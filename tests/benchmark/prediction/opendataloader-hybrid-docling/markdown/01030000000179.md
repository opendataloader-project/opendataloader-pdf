# What tool(s) do you typically use in your course?

Ask whether the instructor utilizes your institution’s course management system (Canvas, Blackboard, etc.), or a separate course website to communicate and share content with students. This may affect the tools and practices you recommend.

# What supporting materials do you utilize for this course?

If the instructor relies on self-grading homework platforms or ancillary presentations and lecture notes from publishers, you will want to discuss the various free and low-cost options available to replace that content (See Chapter 15, Finding Ancillaries for OER).

Alternatively, does the instructor already supplement their course materials with course notes or materials they have personally created? Often, when traditional materials are lacking or require supplement, instructors will create notes, reading lists, or other content to “back up” any traditional, commercial content used in their course. This instructor-created content can be reused with OER as well, or even adapted into a new open resource in the future.
