The other potentially invasive fouler is the tropical American Mytilopsis sallei and M. adamsi which has been recorded invasive in Singapore, Australia, Thailand among other regions. While they are recorded from the Manila South Harbor, there is no evidence that it is invasive as it exists in low abundances.

Newer estimates (2021) on the number of possible IAS in Manila Bay is likely more than 30 species based on more intensive biofouling ecological monitoring and the use environmental DNA in detecting species. When research started in 2006 on IAS in Manila Bay, 3 species were initially observed.
