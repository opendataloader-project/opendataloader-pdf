# 4 Basis Fields

A vector field may be written as a linear combination of basis vector fields. If n is the dimension, then any set of n linearly independent vector fields may be used as a basis. The coordinate basis X is an example of a basis. 1 We will see later that not every basis is a coordinate basis: in order to be a coordinate basis, there must be a coordinate system such that each basis element is the directional derivative operator in a corresponding coordinate direction.

Let e be a tuple of basis vector fields, such as the coordinate basis X . The general vector field v applied to an arbitrary manifold function f can be expressed as a linear combination

v ( f )( m ) = e ( f )( m ) b ( m ) = ∑ i e i ( f )( m ) b i ( m ) , (4.1)

where b is a tuple-valued coefficient function on the manifold. When expressed in a coordinate basis, the coefficients that specify the direction of the vector are naturally expressed as functions b i of the coordinates of the manifold point. Here, the coefficient function b is more naturally expressed as a tuple-valued function on the manifold. If b is the coefficient function expressed as a function of coordinates, then b = b ◦ χ is the coefficient function as a function on the manifold.

The coordinate-basis forms have a simple definition in terms of the coordinate-basis vectors and the coordinates (equation 3.40). With this choice, the dual property, equation (3.41), holds without further fuss. More generally, we can define a basis of one-forms ˜ e that is dual to e in that the property

˜ e i ( e j )( m ) = δ i j (4.2)

is satisfied, analogous to property (3.41). Figure 4.1 illustrates the duality of basis fields.

1 We cannot say if the basis vectors are orthogonal or normalized until we introduce a metric.
