In the 2019-2020 period, content that specifically discusses the SDGs explicitly cannot be found on the Komnas HAM’s YouTube. Nevertheless, on 15 December 2021, the Tanggap Rasa Podcast with the title of “Podcast #EP32: SDGs dan Anak Muda” (Translation: “Podcast #EP32: SDGs and Youth”) has been broadcast and can increase the awareness and understanding of the citizen on the SDGs, especially towards young generations.
