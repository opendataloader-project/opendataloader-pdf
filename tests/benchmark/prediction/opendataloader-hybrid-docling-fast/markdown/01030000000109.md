the jet velocity can be assumed to remain constant. Therefore, the horizontal distance traveled by jet (x) in time (t) is equal to:



The vertical component of the trajectory of the jet will have a constant acceleration downward due to the force of gravity.  Therefore, at any time, t, the y-position of the jet may be calculated as:



Rearranging Equation (8) gives:



Substitution of t and v from Equations 9 and 2 into Equation 7 results in:



Equations (10) can be rearranged to find C v:



Therefore,  for  steady  flow  conditions  (i.e.,  constant  h  in  the  head  tank),  the  value  of C v can  be determined from the x, y coordinates of the jet trajectory. A graph of x plotted against will have a slope of  2 C v .

# 7.2.   DETERMINATION  OF  THE  COEFFICIENT  OF  DISCHARGE

If C d is assumed to be constant, then a graph of Q plotted against (Equation 6) will be linear, and the slope of this graph will be:
