# IMPLEMENTATION

Locally, we implemented a quick and free solution that reflects the constraints of system capabilities, no  financial  support,  and  a  local  directive  to  vet  every  course  to  be  tagged.  Based  on  what  was feasible in the short term and conversations with key stakeholders (i.e., registrar, early OER adopters, curriculum  coordinators,  student  representatives,  and  the  campus  store),  we  incorporated  an 'educational resources cost' option into an existing 'course attribute' drop-down menu under the system's advanced search options.
