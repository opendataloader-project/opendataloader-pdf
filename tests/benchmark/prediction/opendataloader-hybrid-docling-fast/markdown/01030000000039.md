There were very few tourism MSMEs that exported in  each  survey  round. The  base  is  too  small  for  any conclusive analysis.

# 9.5.  Adapting  to  the  New  Normal:  Changing Business Models

In  all  survey  phases, several MSMEs in the tourism sector  reported  changing  their  business  models.  In July 2020, 167 tourism MSMEs mentioned that they changed their business model, in October 2020, 223 mentioned the same, and in January 2021, it was 183 MSMEs. Some changed models in more ways than one. The  main  ways  across  all  phases  that  MSMEs made changes were:

Adapting to social distancing;

Devising new ways to reach customers through online markets or social media;

Moving into new products and services in high demand during COVID-19;

Reducing employee salaries.

Compared to previous survey round results, in January 2021, tourism MSMEs  had  increasingly shifted towards adapting to social distancing to operate (57%). 6  Starting online marketing remained a popular choice, as nearly a quarter (24%) mentioned it in January 2021, compared to 28% in July 2020 and 31% in October 2020. Reducing employee salaries as an approach reduced considerably in January 2021 at 8% of responses compared to 21% in July 2020 and 24% in October 2020.
