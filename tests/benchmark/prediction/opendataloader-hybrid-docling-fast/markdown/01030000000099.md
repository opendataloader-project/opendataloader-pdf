(Pope and Schweitzer 2011)

To reiterate, this study’s main econometric results reveal a negative effect on sinking a putt when the typical golfer is putting for birdie, and a positive effect on putting for bogey. Consistent with the previous graphs, these numerical results suggest that the typical professional golfer is more likely to sink a put for bogey and less likely to sink the putt for birdie (i.e., the typical golfer is indeed loss averse).10

# ARE CIGARETTE SMOKERS HYPERBOLIC TIME DISCOUNTERS?

Recall from Chapter 4 the distinction between time-consistent exponential time discounters (Homo economicus) and potentially time-inconsistent hyperbolic discounters (Homo sapiens). The discounting time paths for exponential versus hyperbolic discounting looked like this:

10. A negative effect associated with putting for double bogey suggests that the typical golfer suppresses his inclination for loss aversion when putting for a score worse than bogey.
