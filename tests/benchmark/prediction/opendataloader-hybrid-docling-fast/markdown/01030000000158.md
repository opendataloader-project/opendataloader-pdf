# Introduction

Throughout the chapters, I tried to generate Reflection & Discussion Questions that could be used either as in class (whole group  or  think/pair/share)  discussion  prompts  or  as  written reflections  assigned  out  of  class.  If  your  students  generate  any written answers to any of the Reflection & Discussion Questions in this chapter, I would be very interested to see them.

# Our Mental Shortcuts
