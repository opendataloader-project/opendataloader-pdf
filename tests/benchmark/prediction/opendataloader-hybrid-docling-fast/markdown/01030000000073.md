In this content, DPN Argentina provides a brief explanation of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda action plans, and most importantly, their role in advancing the 2030 Agenda through the SDGs Monitoring and Evaluation Program with a focus on certain thematic areas. These focuses allow DPN Argentina to investigate through monitoring and  preparing  reports  on  the  development  of  public  policies  and  actions  of organizations responsible for compliance with the SDGs, as well as proposals, and recommendations to strengthen related processes.

Furthermore,  DPN  Argentina  also  regularly  uploads  commemorations  of days related to the SDGs by also including the SDGs logo in each of these uploads. Examples of such greetings are as follows:
