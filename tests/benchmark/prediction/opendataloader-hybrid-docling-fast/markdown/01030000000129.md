n the case that the distributions were identically distributed with expected value and variance of and ,  each partner would face the same expected value as before, .  But, the variance of their individual earnings would be ,  half  of  what it was before without combining their businesses. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the earnings each partner would face would be:

And if n partners joined together, then they would each face the same expected value as before, but the variance each partner would receive is . We now illustrate these important results.

Assume that business one's earnings are determined by outcomes associated with the toss of a fair coin. If the outcome of the coin toss is tails, the firm pays (loses) $5,000. If the toss is a heads, the firm wins $8,000. Thus, the firm wins either $8,000 or loses $5,000 and earns on average (.5) (-5,000) + (.5) (8,000) = $1500.

The standard deviation of this risky outcomes is:

(15.21)

Furthermore, assuming a normal distribution, 68% of the time, the average outcome will be between the mean and plus or minus one standard deviation: ($1,500 + $6,500) = $8,000 and ($1,500 - $6,500) = -$5,000.

Now suppose that two persons decide to combine their operations and share the average of the outcomes.  Then  the  possible  outcomes  of  two  coin  tosses  are  two  heads  (H,  H)  which  earns  on average $16,000 / 2 = $8,000 and occurs with a probability of .25; two tails (T, T) which earns on average -$10,000 / 2 = -$5,000 and occurs with a probability of .25, and one head and one tail (H, T) or one tail and one head (T, H) which both earn on average $3,000 / 2 = $1,500 and each occurs with a probability of .25. The expected value for each of the two players can now can be expressed as:

(15.22)

The  two  players  now  receive  on  average  the  same  as  before,  $1,500,  but  consider  the  standard deviation of the average outcome:
