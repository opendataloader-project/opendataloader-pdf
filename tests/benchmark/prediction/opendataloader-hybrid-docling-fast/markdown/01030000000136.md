Over time, an angler's motivation may change from a catch orientation to emphasize noncatch motivations, such as being outdoors or passing on their passion for fishing (McKenna 2013). The progression often follows these stages:

Stage 1: I just want to catch a fish!

Stage 2: I want to catch a lot of fish!

Stage 3: I want to catch big fish.

Stage 4: I'm just happy to be out fishing.

Stage 5: I want to pass on my knowledge and passion for fishing.

Studies of angler characteristics confirm that there is no such thing as an 'average' angler. Rather, anglers are a heterogeneous and changing group. Therefore, we can segment anglers in distinct categories for analysis (Bryan  1977;  Kyle  et  al.  2007;  Beardmore  et  al.  2013;  TenHarmsel  et  al.  2019).  For  example,  Magee  (2018) categorized recreational anglers into five distinct fisher classes with differing motivations (Table 10.1).
