In the Philippines, of the returning Filipino migrant workers in 2020, 55 percent earned a monthly income of between PHP20,000 and PHP50,000, and 19 percent earned between PHP5000 and PHP20,000. Before their return, 50 percent reported remitting amounts ranging from PHP10,000 to PHP20,000 (US$200 to US$400) monthly. It is highly unlikely that the families of these migrant  workers  would  have  savings  to  rely  on  after  they  lost  their  jobs. Additionally, 83 percent of these workers were still unemployed after three months, resulting in a 60 percent drop in household income for 48 percent of the returned migrant workers.
