During the first Aquino administration (1986–1992), three women sectoral representatives were appointed in Congress. Yet feminist activists such as Teresita Quintos-Deles and Jurgette Honculada’s appointments were blocked by the House Committee on Appointments (Abao and Yang 2001, 19).

While reliable electoral data during the Marcos regime is unavailable, it is safe to argue that the repressive regime hampered the participation of women in formal politics given the widespread militarization and electoral fraud characterizing the dictatorship. And even with the legal framework guaranteed by the transition, women found it difficult to enter formal politics, despite women’s consistently high voter turnout during elections (Table 1).
