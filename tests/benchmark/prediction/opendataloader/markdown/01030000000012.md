theatrical prints, which are informed by interculturation and illustrate the Orientalized look of the tale’s theatrical life: one of John (“Jack”) Peter Bologna as Kalim Azack, the vizier’s son betrothed to Badroulboudour, and one of the extraordinary pantomime clown Joseph Grimaldi as Kazrac, the magician’s Chinese slave, who, disillusioned by the magician’s cruel plans concerning the lamp, befriends Aladdin (figs. 5.1 and 5.2). The creation of this non-speaking role (Kazrac’s tongue had been removed by the “Tartarian Hord” from whom the magician rescued him) added much to the play, besides giving both the magician and Aladdin an ally and a confidant. Interestingly, these two prints likely represent a notable scene in the play, certainly a favorite with children playing with a toy theater. The prints show Kalim Azack and Kazrac fighting while Aladdin follows the princess to the royal baths. The wealthy Kalim Azack is depicted wearing an elaborate ensemble: long embroidered tunic with fringe, short jacket with embroidery and tassels, full trousers tucked into boots, a sash,

necklace, earrings, and brooches. With his fanciful hat and long moustache, he depicts a theatrical version of “a Tartar,” or “a Man from Crimea.” An illustration with the same title was included in an 1804 edition of The Costume of Turkeythat aptly associates Kalim Azack with the “Tartarian Hord” responsible for Kazrac’s disfigurement.41 Kazrac’s “Chinese” costume resembles contemporary Qing Dynasty (1636–1912) fashion with itschangshantunic, long, loose trousers, and a cap with upturned brim, topped with a knob. Despite his role as a poor peasant, Kazrac’s theatrical costume is embellished with embroidery and a gold trim, and the character wears white stockings. Additionally, Grimaldi sports a braided pigtail and long moustache and brandishes two curved swords. Taken together, these two cultural images exemplify the Orientalized look that contributed to the fantasy
