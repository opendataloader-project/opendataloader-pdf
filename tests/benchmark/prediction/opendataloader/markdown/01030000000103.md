WITH CHATGPT

СREATING SLIDES

- 01 - Find Open Educational Resources
- 02- Prepare Your Content
- 03- Generate Slides with ChatGPT
- 04 - Create App Script Code
- 05 - Execute in Google Apps Script


Start by searching for information on platforms like OER Commons, where authors share their materials freely, ensuring no copyright issues.

Summarize or extract the key points from the materials you've found. This will be the content for your slides.

Provide the summarized content to ChatGPT and instruct it to create a structured outline for Google Slides, including titles, main points, and any specific instructions for slide design.

After finalizing the slide structure, ask ChatGPT to generate a Google Apps Script code that can create these slides automatically.

Open Google Apps Script, start a new project, and paste the code provided by ChatGPT. Run the script to auto-generate your slide deck.

06 - Edit and Customize

Once the slides are created, you can further edit and customize them in Google Slides according to your needs.
