- 3. Mix reagents by pipetting gently up and down.
- 4. Incubate all of the reaction tubes for 1 hour at 37 oC.


NOTE: Your instructor will freeze your completed restriction digests at -20 oC until the next lab period. III. Electrophorese Digests Reagents:

- • Restriction digests from Part II, on ice
- • 10x loading dye, 10 𝜇𝜇L


Supplies and Equipment

- • Gel electrophoresis chamber with agarose gel in gel tray, power supply
- • 1-20 𝜇𝜇L Micropipette and pipet tips


## Load the Gel

- 1. Use a micropipette to add 2 𝜇𝜇L of 10× loading dye to a reaction tube. Use the pipet tip and gently pipet up and down a couple of times to mix the 10× loading dye with the digested DNA. Use a new pipet tip and repeat for each digest.
- 2. Use a micropipette to load the contents of each reaction tube (20 𝜇𝜇L total) into a separate well in the gel. Use a fresh pipet tip for each reaction tube and write down the order in which the samples are loaded.


NOTE: Be careful not to punch the tip of the pipet through the bottom or side of the well.

While loading,

- • steady the pipet over the well using two hands. You may wish to place one or both elbows on the lab bench to steady your hands.
- • be careful to expel any air in the pipet tip end before loading the gel. If an air bubble forms a cap over the well, the sample will flow into the buffer around the edges of the well.
