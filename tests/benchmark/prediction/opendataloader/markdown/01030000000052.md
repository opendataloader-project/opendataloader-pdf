15Overcoming Barriers to Filipino Women’s Political Representation

the way for women to enter the House of Representatives. In 2019, 20 women from party lists have contributed to the increase in female legislators. However, the Party-List Law’s implementation has been controversial owing to the entry of political dynasties and traditional politicians. The ideal that it serve as the gateway to political power of disadvantaged groups has been lost due to vague provisions in the law and subsequent Supreme Court decisions. The party list system has also been “co-opted by the traditional political system or have become the training ground for future influence-peddling traditional politicians” (Tigno 2019). In other words, it has deviated from the idea of proportional representation practiced in other countries. Dynastic families took advantage of the system’s flaws and used them to field relatives, including some women, to expand their political power. However, recent interviews with legislators from progressive party lists demonstrate a better understanding of women’s issues than some representatives elected from single-member districts (Encinas-Franco 2022, 157).
