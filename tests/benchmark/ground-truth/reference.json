If they are not, we must do something more\ncomplicated, with the best choice being the bias-corrected and accelerated\n(BCa) approach. Because of the large number of fits that are required,\nbootstrapping is fairly slow. If the experiment contains many trials, the BCa\nmethod makes it even slower (because it incorporates additional \"jackknife\"\nresampling, implying one further fitting iteration for almost every trial).18",

          "text": "Let's begin by considering a metric I have not yet mentioned: Deviance. De-\nviance (sometimes called G2) is a measure based on log likelihood, but which\nlooks rather more like summed squared error, in that it is zero for a perfectly\nfitting model and large/positive for a poorly fitting model. Formally, deviance\nis two times the difference in log likelihood between the saturated model and\nthe model with our current set of parameters. A saturated model is one that\nexactly predicts the data (which can always be accomplished by a model that\nhas one parameter per data point). Hence it represents the situation with the\nmaximum possible log-likelihood when predicting this particular set of data.\nDeviance is closely related to a simpler calculation (-2 \u00d7 log likelihood) that\nforms the basis of a couple of well-known metrics for model comparison (the\nAkaike information criterion, AIC, and the Bayesian information criterion,\nBIC) and indeed is occasionally defined this way. That's because we are of-\nten only really interested in differences (in Deviance, or AIC, or BIC) between\nmodels, and the log-likelihood of the saturated model gets subtracted out in a\ncomparison between two models (because it has contributed to the deviance\nin the same way for both) SO calculating it is not necessary.",

          "text": "The 2xSJ task provides estimates that correlate fairly well with equivalent\nparameters estimated using TOJs, SJs, and ternary tasks. However, each trial\ntakes longer than in those single-presentation tasks, which makes experi-\nments more onerous. There are a few reasons why the roving-standard 2xSJ is\nstill worth considering. Firstly, it asks about synchrony explicitly (unlike the\nTOJ) and by requiring relative judgements it reveals a point of maximal syn-\nchrony perception (whereas the SJ and ternary tasks often reveal a range of\nSOA values that are classified as synchronous). Secondly, it can be added in\nto a single-presentation task (as a follow-up question every two trials), which\nsomewhat mitigates the burden of additional experimental time. Finally, a case\ncan be made that it will be more resistant to some forms of decision-level bias\n(Morgan, Grant, Melmoth, & Solomon, 2015; Morgan, Melmoth, & Solomon,\n2013). As with the other tasks I have described, code to fit data from the 2xSJ\naccompanies this chapter.23 For further information, read the comments there\nand consult Yarrow et al. (2016).",

In doing so, I have presented\none particular observer model in some detail, and highlighted the fundamen-\ntally subjective nature of the SJ task, which requires us to think carefully about\nhow both the strategic decisions and perceptual sensitivity of a participant\ncan affect their psychometric function. I have gone on to supply a brief over-\nview of appropriate models for several closely related timing tasks. I hope I\nhave also provided enough of a tutorial regarding bespoke model fitting and\nevaluation to allow the interested reader to go forward and explore their own\nmodels of perceived simultaneity. Modelling may seem intimidating, but in\nfact, a good understanding of just a few basic concepts (which is best gained\nthrough practical exploration) will take you a long way, providing tools to\nengage more fully with the timing literature. This is an endeavour I would very\nmuch encourage!",

          "text": "Thus, as Makdisi and Nussbaum sum up in their\nintroduction to The Arabian Nights in Historical\nContext: Between East and West, \"the Nights offered\na particularly powerful vision of an Asiatic culture\nseemingly saturated with references to sensuality,\nextravagance, indulgence, violence, supernatural-\nism, and eroticism ... [and] added a supernatural\ndimension to the Enlightenment; the tales offered\nan avenue into modernity through its magical op-\nposite, an alternative to European identity, and an\nantidote to neoclassicism.\"87 However, reading\nsuch imports as an expression of European pow-\ners' disavowal of the East in order to \"justify their\nconquest and rule over other peoples, particularly\nin Asia,\"88 is an oversimplification of a rather com-\nplicated process of cultural exchange. None of\nthese descriptions of Arabia were caused by colo-\nnial \"distortions,\" as Said feared, but by false attri-\nbutions: \"Arabian\" was a misnomer that rarely de-\nscribed Arabia itself. While fictional narratives like\nArabian Nights' Entertainments represented Ara-\nbia as a land of magic and exorbitant riches, they\nwere too far-fetched to be part of a Westerner's\nbelief system during the Age of Reason; rather,\nthey were popularized because their wild fiction-\nality turned them into bestsellers at the time. Such\nstories competed with descriptions of the Arabi-\nan Peninsula by travelers and traders who had vis-\nited the area and had unmediated contact with the\nlocal culture. However, while the Orientalist litera-\nture described Arabia in terms that emphasized\nits exoticism, magic, superstitions, extravagance,\nwealth, eroticism, excess, and myriads of other pe-\nculiarities that contrasted it with the European\nnormativity, travel narratives created an \"Arabian\"\nidentity that was generally congruent with the\nreality of the place.",

During the extreme phases, this assumption is no longer reasonable. Again\nthe model will be extremely simplified, but still it is based on physical intuition and,\nmost importantly, completely time symmetric. Assume that the only types of edges\nhaving a non-neglectable chance of occurring during the extreme phase\n[-m - 1, -m] are of the following two kinds: The first scenario is that the universe\npasses through the extreme phase into a state of zero entropy. The other scenario is\nthat it passes into a state with high entropy (equal to 2m). Universes of one of these\ntwo types will be given the (un-normalized) probability 1 or p, respectively. Here\np> 0 should be thought of as a very small number, at least when the size of the\nmodel becomes large.

However, they do represent the following viewpoint\nof what may happen at the full cosmological scale: we may think of the Big Bang and\nthe Big Crunch as states of complete order with zero volume and entropy. Such\nstates can very well be metastable, very much like an oversaturated gas at a tem-\nperature below the point of condensation. If no disturbance takes place, such meta-\nstable states can very well continue to exist for a substantial period of time. In\nparticular, a low-entropy state can have a very good chance of surviving the intense\nbut extremely short extreme phase. On the other hand, if a sufficiently large dis-\nturbance occurs, then the metastable state may almost immediately decay into a\nvery disordered state of high entropy.",

In the case\nof a weak broken symmetry, this is not necessarily so; it could very well be that the\nmost probable scenario would be high entropy at both ends. Thus, this is definitely a\nweaker statement, but it can nevertheless be argued that it can be used to explain\nthe time asymmetry that we observe, referring to a kind of anthropic principle: it is\nan obvious observational fact that we live in a universe with low entropy at at least\none end. If the statement in Definition 4 is fulfilled, then clearly among such\nscenarios, the monotonic ones (LH and HL) are the by far most probable ones.\nThus, since universes with high entropy at both ends would seem to be quite\nuninhabitable, one can argue that given the existence of an observer, then with\nalmost certainty he must live in a universe with monotonic entropy.",

Historians argue that Spain's strong\nCatholic traditions ushered in patriarchal norms and practices that were\nnot present in the pre-Hispanic period. National hero, Jose Rizal, has\ndocumented this in his \"Letter to the Women of Malolos,\" praising the\nwomen for advocating their right to education. Historians also found\nproof of women's contribution to the Philippine revolution (Camagay\n1998). Decades later, the suffragist movement ushered in one of the first\nnational issues to have brought Filipino women together. It was a hard-\nfought battle; the movement had to contend with staunch opposition\nfrom antisuffragists in the Constitutional Convention that drafted the\n1935 Constitution. The reluctance was expected because only 21-year-\nold Filipino men had been allowed to vote during the time. They framed\ntheir opposition based on traditional notions of womanhood and their\nrole in the private sphere, foremost of which is motherhood. Another\nkey argument against female suffrage was the idea that politics is\nsupposed to be \"dirty\" and that this would taint families if women took\npart in politics. The assumptions catered to the age-old public-private\ndivide, strongly suggesting that only men are qualified to occupy the\nformer.",

When signing the law paving the way for the said plebiscite,\nPresident Manuel Quezon had this to say to Filipino men: \"Are you\ngoing to deprive our women of the opportunity to say how their lives\nare going to be regulated and is it fair for us to presume that men can\nalways speak in this country for women?\" (Official Gazette 1936). In\nApril 1937, more than 400,000 women voted in favor of their right to\nvote and participate in political life. In 1946 and 1947, Filipinos elected\nthe first woman member of the House of Representatives, and senator,\nrespectively. Nonetheless, data from 1946 to 1992 indicate an uphill\nclimb. For instance, in the 1949 and 1953 elections for the House of\nRepresentatives, only one woman was elected out of the 100 positions.",

Roces (2012,\n6) attributes this to the burgeoning student movement and activism, so\nmuch so that by the time Marcos declared martial law, women were\nprepared to take on the resistance.

The democratic transition provided political\nopportunity structures and venues ensuring women's access to the\nstate and nonstate spheres. The drafting of the 1987 Constitution\nwas one such opportunity. The movement managed to advocate for\nimportant provisions paving the way for women's rights legislation\nfrom the 1980s to the present. The provision in the 1987 Constitution\nmandates the state to recognize \"the role of women in nation building\nand shall ensure the fundamental equality before the law of men and\nwomen\" (Article 2, Section 14). This provision is said to be unique and\nis not even found in other countries' charters (Masilungan n.d.).",

The party list system\nhas also been \"co-opted by the traditional political system or have\nbecome the training ground for future influence-peddling traditional\npoliticians\" (Tigno 2019). In other words, it has deviated from the idea\nof proportional representation practiced in other countries. Dynastic\nfamilies took advantage of the system's flaws and used them to field\nrelatives, including some women, to expand their political power.\nHowever, recent interviews with legislators from progressive party\nlists demonstrate a better understanding of women's issues than some\nrepresentatives elected from single-member districts (Encinas-Franco\n2022, 157).",

Diesel consumption in the industry sector decreased significantly, around 10% per\nyear between 2010 and 2019, resulting from the shift to another energy type. During the\nsame period, with some fluctuations, diesel production increased at 3.6% annual growth\nrate, while imports were cut by half from nearly 13 billion litres in 2010 to nearly 6.5 billion\nlitres in 2018. The biodiesel blending rate increased from only 1% in 2010 to nearly 20%\nin 2019, representing a growing level of mandatory biodiesel programmes. Apparently,\ndiesel imports dropped with the increase of the biodiesel (B100) blending rate.",

Hence, biomass co-firing\nwith coal does not have a rationale to receive support through the FIT scheme since it\ncould make profits without it. For reference, Figure 4.3 illustrates a biomass co-firing ratio\nof the major power utilities' coal-fired power plants. Nearly half of the coal-fired power\nplants co-combusted biomass in FY2019 and most of them are less than 1% ratio of\nbiomass.",

          "text": "Dispersal by purely natural means is not included as a pathway of biological invasions (Gaston\n1996). Examples include range expansion by flight or any other medium of natural locomotion or\ntransport. However if human created or crafted material is involved in rafting dispersal of IAS,\nthen this may be considered as a case of biological invasion. The 2011 Great East Japan\nearthquake generated a large tsunami that caused an unprecedented biological transoceanic\nrafting event from the northwestern Pacific coastline of Japan towards North America on the\neastern Pacific(Carlton et al. 2017). Millions of human made objects from small plastics to large\ndocks and whole ships were cast adrift in the Pacific (Murray et al. 2018). This provided a\nsubstrate for biofoulers. Large debris could carry up to 20 to 30 mega-species of biofoulers\n(Carlton et al. 2017). These biofouled debris can constitute an IAS risk (Therriault 2017).",

Paper-based wrappers are another alternative for bagels and sandwich\npapers. Containers and packaging can use plastics with a certain percentage of recycled\ncontent and designed to be recyclable or reusable. Highly recyclable packaging is of\nlittle benefit if it is not disposed of correctly. The success of a recyclable package is an\nequal demand from recycling companies through improved recyclability of packaging\nand investments in efficient recycling facilities and systems. This requires investment and\ninnovation since quality and availability are still often a stumbling block for companies\nto use recycled plastic.

According to the ILO (2021c), female\nemployment in AMS in 2020 was 3.9 percent lower than the expected level,\nwhich is markedly less than the 2.7 percent figure for male employment.6\nThe impact of the pandemic on employment is evident in lower labour force\nparticipation, lower working hours, and higher unemployment rates in most\ncountries (Figure 1.5).",

          "text": "4 There are of course long-standing reasons for the labour shortages in these sectors, which accounts for\ntheir high reliance for migrant workers, including poor working conditions, that is prone to abuse, and lack\nof attractiveness for local workers (Looi, 2020; Ng, 2020; ILO, 2015).\n5 McKinsey Global Institute (2020) estimates that at the beginning of the pandemic, women accounted for\nmore than half of total job losses from COVID-19 though they made up only two-fifths of the global labour\nforce. This is because they are overrepresented in sectors hardest hit by the pandemic: accommodation\nand food services; retail and wholesale trade; and other services, such as arts, recreation, and public\nadministration.\n6 This is equivalent to saying there is greater increase in unemployment or inactivity for women compared\nto men. According to the report, one reason is the increase in unpaid care responsibilities for women as\nschools closed (ILO, 2021c).",

We have all heard the saying that \"words matter.\" The titles and descriptions we use to distinguish people and their\nbehaviors (e.g., Homo economicus vs. Homo sapiens) can reinforce or diminish behaviors such as pride in cultural heritage,\nrespect for the living world, and trust in community, a process known as \"crowding out\" of \"intrinsic motivation and\ncommitment.\" As an example of this phenomenon, Bauer et al. (2012) asked participants in an online survey to imagine\nthemselves as one of four households facing a water shortage due to a drought affecting their shared well. The survey\nassigned the label \"consumers\" to half of the participants and \"individuals\" to the other half. Those imagining themselves as\nconsumers reported feeling less personal responsibility to reduce their water demand, and less trust in others to do the\nsame, than did those referred to as individuals. As we are about to learn, behavioral economics is all about exposing these\ntypes of \"framing effects\" existing in the \"real world\" inhabited by Homo sapiens.",

The thought experiments in Section 1 are, for the\nmost part, re-castings of the simple cognitive tests devised by psychologists and economists over the\npast three-to-four decades to illustrate the fallacies, miscalculations, and biases distinguishing Homo\nsapiens from Homo economicus. Similarly, the laboratory experiments presented in Section 2 are, for the\nmost part, re-castings of the seminal experiments conducted by Kahneman and Tversky (among many\nothers). These experiments helped motivate the revised theories of human choice behavior, such as\nKahneman and Tversky's (1979) Prospect Theory, which form another pillar of behavioral economics.\nAlongside these experiments, Section 2 presents the revised theories of human choice behavior with\nvarying degrees of rigor. This is where the theoretical bases of Homo economicus' rational choice\nbehavior are examined, and where key refinements to this theory are developed-theoretical\nrefinements underpinning the myriad departures from rational choice behavior we witness Homo\nsapiens make in this section's laboratory and field experiments (and which are examined further in\nSections 3 and 4).",

For example, the first set of thought experiments presented in Section 1\nis meant to demonstrate firsthand to the students the extent to which automatic, knee-jerk responses\nfrom what Kahneman (2011) identifies as the System 1 portion of the brain can result in\nmiscalculations. Students who choose to read ahead (small in number though these types of students\nmay be) potentially skew the distribution of responses away from its otherwise true representation\nof these miscalculations. Such skewness may be tolerable for strictly educational purposes, where the\ngoal is to demonstrate that at least a certain percentage of students are prone to miscalculation. But if\nthe instructor also hopes to compile student responses into a dataset amenable for statistical analysis,\n2\nthen this type of potential bias draws into question the validity of the data.",

Psychological momentum is defined as the tendency of an outcome (such as a win in an\ninitial judo match) to be followed by a similar outcome (a win in a subsequent match) that is not caused by any strategic\nincentives of the players. The authors point out that this result is consistent with evidence in the biological literature that",

We also know that Player 1\nrecognizes that she gets a payoff of $0 if she concedes in the first round, regardless of Player 2's type.\nIf she instead chooses to invade in the first round, then Player 1's expected payoff from invading is\np - 0.2(1 - p) = 1.2p - 0.2. This is merely the weighted average of Player 1's expected payoff\nwhen Player 2 is weak and her expected payoff when Player 2is strong. Thus, invade is a better strategy\nthan concede for Player 1 when 1.2p - 0.2 > 0 \u21d2 p > 1/6. In other words, if the probability that\nPlayer 1 assigns to Player 2 being weak is greater than one-sixth, Player 1 should choose to invade in the\nfirst round.

Three final experiments tested the effects of money on social intimacy, desire to engage in\nleisure activities alone, and preference to work alone.

On August 1st, 2015, the city began providing a\n\"green nudge\" to citizens living in its urban core area with the introduction of the Clear Bag Policy, a\npolicy designed to nudge households toward more responsible sorting of their waste, which, in turn,\nwould result in an overall reduction in the total amount of waste generated. As Akbulut-Yuksel and\nBoulatoff point out, under the new policy, households were mandated to replace their black garbage\nbags, traditionally used for the disposal of their refuse, with clear, transparent bags. The Clear Bag\nPolicy allowed households to put out the same number of garbage bags at the curb (six every other\nweek), but all waste destined for the landfill was required to be disposed of in a clear bag (except for\none dark bag permitted for privacy's sake). This allowed waste collectors to screen and refuse any bags\ncontaining materials that should otherwise have been diverted from the landfill, such as recyclables,\nfood waste, and hazardous waste. Clear bags also made apparent to everyone, neighbors and passersby\nalike, a given household's waste-generation and disposal habits.33",

          "text": "One of the characteristics of living things is the ability\nto replicate and passon genetic information to the next\ngeneration. Cell division in individual bacteria and\narchaea usually occurs by binary fission. Mitochondria\nand chloroplasts also replicate by binary fission, which\nis evidence of the evolutionary relationship between\nthese organelles and prokaryotes.\nCell division in eukaryotes is more complex. It requires\nthe cell to manage acomplicated process of duplicating\nthe nucleus, other organelles, and multiple linear\nchromosomes. It is controlled in the cell cycle, which is\ndivided into three parts: interphase, mitosis, and\ncytokinesis. We spilt those further for ease of study.\nLet's start with interphase, which is broken into three\nstages. In the first growth phase (G1), the cell grows and\nprepares to duplicate its DNA. In the synthesis phase\n(S), the chromosomes are replicated. In the second\ngrowth phase (G2), the cell prepares to divide.",

Among those who fish for sport, only 27% of U.S. anglers are female (Burkett and Carter 2020).\nUnderrepresentation of females in sportfishing is ironic, as the first publication on fly-fishing, dating from the\n15th century, was written by Dame Juliana Berners, entitled Treatyse of Fysshynge with an Angle, a publication\nthat heavily influenced novelty of the sport for European enthusiasts. Though sometimes invisible, women are\nslowly changing the world of sportfishing by breaking stereotypes. Future growth of sportfishing will rely on\nfemale anglers, instructors, and guides. Here I share a few examples on women making a substantial impact\nthrough their passion toward fishing. These examples demonstrate women who loved and valued what they\ndid. If the paucity of female role models discourages females from seeing the relevance of fishing to them, these\nexamples should inspire.",

Georgina\nBallantine holds the British record for a 64-pound rod-caught\nAtlantic Salmon from River Tay, Scotland, in 1922 (Figure 7.5). Joan\nWulff was introduced to fly-fishing by her father when she was\nten and won several fly-fishing accuracy championships before\nwinning the 1951 Fishermen's Distance competition against all-\nmale competitors. She became the first female spokesperson for\nGarcia Corporation in 1959 and advocated for women anglers in\nher writings for Outdoor Life and Rod & Reel. Today, females make\nup 30% of participants in the sport of fly-fishing (Recreational\nFishing and Boating Foundation 2021). Joan Wulff participated in\nmany distance casting events and did trick casting. She snapped a\ncigarette from the mouth of Johnny Carson on the TV show \"Who\nDo You Trust?\" (Fogt 2017). Starting in 1978, Wulff opened a fly-\ncasting school on the Upper Beaverkill River in New York. Her Fly-\nCasting Techniques, published in 1987, and New Fly-Casting\nTechniques, published in 2012, are classic guides to learning her\ntechniques. When asked about her favorite fish, she would\nrespond, \"Whatever I'm fishing for,\" and her favorite place to fish\nwas \"Wherever I am.\"",

Juvenile Alligator Gars quickly transition to fish-eating habits (Butler et al. 2018).\nA fish diet means the juveniles grow at 4-5 mm per day in the first three months of life, so that by the end of the\nfirst growing season they may reach 1.5 to 2 feet in length (~40-70 cm) and 8-10 pounds in weight (Sakaris et al.\n2019).

Here I review the history\nof trout fishing and fly-fishing with special focus on the Rocky Mountain West, where fly fishers first exerted\ntheir influence on conservation ethics and sportfishing policy. Although many individuals and organizations\nplayed roles, I concentrate on only two: Fly Fishers International (FFI) and Trout Unlimited (TU). These two\norganizations had similar interests in conservation, but important differences prevented them from working\ntogether on a unified goal of conservation. The legacy of fly-fishing demonstrates the importance of passion,\npersistence, and partnerships in fish conservation.",

Norman Maclean's novel, A River Runs through It (1976), begins, \"In our family there was no\n\nclear line between religion and fly fishing.\" Later Maclean writes that \"Something within fishermen tries to\nmake fishing into a world perfect and apart.\" The iconography of Western fly-fishing that Maclean and others\nwrote about was created by anglers, fisheries managers, tourists, guides, businesses, and region promoters. The\nhistory of Rocky Mountain fly-fishing parallels the history of the expansion of our Western frontier as well as\nfisheries management (Brown 2015). Although Henry David Thoreau (1862) maintained that \"In wildness is the\npreservation of the world,\" humans are part of the trout fishing system and helped create, destroy, maintain,\nand restore the trout fishing we have today.",

They also caught fish by hand via tickling.\nTickling for trout involves rubbing the underbelly of a trout with fingers to get the trout to go into a trance, after\nwhich they can then easily be thrown onto the bank (Martindale 1901). Native Americans were more patient\nthan others. This method is different from noodling for catfish, where the noodler uses fingers as bait and grabs\nthe catfish by its mouth. Native Americans also caught fish by fly-fishing with deer-hair flies, according to the\nwritings of early American naturalist William Bartram (1739-1823) (Monahan, no date).",

Uninhabited wilderness had to be created through the dispossession of Native\npeople before it could be preserved (Spence 1999). Explorers, trappers, pioneers, soldiers, and homesteaders\nbrought fishing gear to frontier outposts. The Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804-1806) included a designated\nangler named Silas Goodrich. The expedition first described several new species of fish, including the\nYellowstone Cutthroat Trout and Westslope Cutthroat Trout, caught by Goodrich. Later military expeditions\nspent time trout fishing in addition to fighting Native Americans. Custer's Last Stand at Little Bighorn might\nhave been avoided if he'd joined a column of reinforcements under General George Crook. Crook's soldiers\nwere comfortably camped close by on Goose Creek near the Tongue River-fishing, not fighting (Monnett 1993;\nOwens 2002a; Lessner 2010).",

High creel limits may cause anglers to have unrealistic\nexpectations about the potential supply of fish compared to the demand (Cook et al. 2001). Creel limit\nreductions may be unsuccessful in reducing angler harvest or affecting fish populations. The hypothetical\nangler success graph (Figure 10.5) demonstrates that a reduction in creel from 8 to 4 would affect only a few\ntrips and result in a small harvest reduction. Furthermore, creel limits are applied on a per-angler basis, SO they\ncannot control total harvest if total fishing effort increases or if noncompliance is high. Finally, since anglers\nhave a variety of motivations, they likely respond differently to regulation changes (Beard et al. 2011).",

As they near the Arapaima, the harpooner throws the harpoon by hand.\nThis is a specialized type of fishing, and the local fishers possess knowledge of the behavior that increases\ntheir likelihood of catching one.

The western\nand central Pacific Ocean is where many artisanal and industrial fisheries overlap. For the small island nations,\nfishing provides a major source of income, jobs, and food security (Bell et al. 2019). Yet, Pacific island nations\nhave not fully realized the economic potential with the global tuna industry, despite the fact that 80% of it is\ncaught within their exclusive economic zones (EEZs, i.e., within 200 miles). The 1982 United Nations Convention\non the Law of the Sea awarded coastal states sovereign rights to (1) exploit and manage all living resources\nwithin their EEZ, (2) exclude distant water fleets in favor of developing their own fleets, and (3) charge distant\nwater fleets rent for access. Eight island nations-the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,\nNauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu, which support 80% of the purse-seine catch in\ntheir waters-formed an alliance and require collective bargaining to set rents for access by foreign vessels. The\nalliance also prioritized domestic over foreign vessels and set limits on the number of purse-seine vessels. The\nissue of sovereignty over tuna that migrate freely among EEZs remains a concern for small island nations (Bailey\net al. 2012). Working to establish fair and equitable allocations of total allowable catches to the many parties will\nrequire more equitable sharing with the larger tuna-fishing nations.",

Because it takes a long time for\nscientists to obtain needed life history information, fisheries-\nindependent survey data, and catch history, grouper\npopulations may be overfished long before data are even\navailable for a stock assessment. Without formal stock\nassessments, general indicators of population status are\nbased on catch trends. Very few grouper stocks that have\nspawning aggregations are managed sustainably. In a recent\nglobal analysis of the status of populations that form\nspawning aggregations, 45% were unknown, 33% were\ndecreasing, and 5% were already gone (Figure 13.5). Only 12%\nhad stable populations, and 5% were increasing.",

          "text": "Everyone who possesses a car and/or a driver's licence is familiar with speeding tickets. In\nThe Netherlands, speeding tickets are usually processed in a fully automated fashion, and the\nperpetrator will receive the tickets within a couple of weeks after the offence. The Dutch police\noptimized the procedures of speed control such that this effort has become very profitable to the\nDutch government. Various strategies for speed control are carried out by police forces, which\nare all based on the position of the vehicle at consecutive times. The actual velocity follows from\nthe first-order derivative of the position of the vehicle with respect to time. Since no explicit\nformula for this position is available, the velocity can only be estimated using an approximation\nof the velocity based on several discrete vehicle positions at discrete times. This motivates the use\nof approximate derivatives, also called numerical derivatives. If the police want to know whether\nthe offender drove faster before speed detection (in other words, whether the perpetrator hit the\nbrakes after having seen the police patrol), or whether the driver was already accelerating, then\nthey are also interested in the acceleration of the 'bad guy'. This acceleration can be estimated\nusing numerical approximations of the second-order derivative of the car position with respect\nto time.",

In most cases, the truncation error increases with an increasing size of the recording interval\n(Sections 3.2 and 3.4). Next to the truncation error, the measurement of the position of the vehicle\nis also prone to measurement errors. Issues that influence the results are, for example, paral-\nlax, the measurement equipment, and in some cases even the performance of the police officer\n(in car-videoing and laser control). These measurement errors provide an additional deteriora-\ntion of the approximation of the speed and acceleration. The impact of measurement errors on\napproximations of derivatives is treated in Section 3.3.",

However, not all groups are\nequally represented in higher education. Degree\ncompletion is uneven across race and income factors\n(among others), making academia not\ndemographically representative of our society as a\nwhole. Some perspectives are therefore\nsystematically underrepresented in groups with\nadvanced degrees.\n\u00b7 Peer Review: Peer review sometimes only results in\ncollaborative improvements to a work. It can also\nprevent the publication of very obviously flawed or\npoorly executed or analyzed research. Very new or\nradical ideas may be initially rejected because they\nare such a departure from existing dogma. Peer\nreview is largely a practice of academia, therefore has\nthe same exclusionary problems mentioned in the\ncredentials section. It is possible for individual\nreviewers to act in a biased or unethical way to\nprevent the publication of some works.\n\u00b7 Fact Checking: Not a lot of downside here. Let me\nknow if your students come up with anything good.\n\u00b7 Domains: For some top level domains (mostly just\n.gov and .edu) looking at the domain provides some\nassurance that the web content there is an official\ncommunication of a particular institution. There\nreally isn't any problem with domains excluding",

Just as you\ncan catch more rain with a garbage can than with a coffee cup, large\ntelescopes gather much more light than your eye can. Second, there\nis an instrument attached to the telescope that sorts the incoming\nradiation by wavelength. Sometimes the sorting is fairly crude. For\nexample, we might simply want to separate blue light from red\nlight SO that we can determine the temperature of a star. But at\nother times, we want to see individual spectral lines to determine\nwhat an object is made of, or to measure its speed (as explained\nin the Radiation and Spectra chapter). Third, we need some type\nof detector, a device that senses the radiation in the wavelength\nregions we have chosen and permanently records the observations.",

IRAS was equipped\nwith a 0.6-meter telescope cooled to a temperature of less than 10\nK. For the first time, the infrared sky could be seen as if it were\nnight, rather than through a bright foreground of atmospheric and\ntelescope emissions. IRAS carried out a rapid but comprehensive\nsurvey of the entire infrared sky over a 10-month period, cataloging\nabout 350,000 sources of infrared radiation. Since then, several\nother infrared telescopes have operated in space with much better\nsensitivity and resolution due to improvements in infrared\ndetectors. The most powerful of these infrared telescopes is the\n0.85-meter Spitzer Space Telescope, which launched in 2003. A\nfew of its observations are shown in Figure 2. With infrared\nobservations, astronomers can detect cooler parts of cosmic\nobjects, such as the dust clouds around star nurseries and the\nremnants of dying stars, that visible-light images don't reveal.",

As a program manager, you will need to find ways to implement your messaging\nand events on campus. Leveraging annual events like Open Education Week in March and\nInternational Open Access Week in October can ground your work in a given time of year and\nfocus your programming around a topic or theme (Open Education Global, n.d.; SPARC, n.d.).\nThe Open Education Week website lists past events and provides downloadable promotional\nmaterials to help you kickstart your event planning and coordination. If these weeks regularly\nconflict with other events at your institution, that's okay. You can celebrate Open Education Week\nthe week before or after it falls. So long as you are consistent in the general time you hold these\nevents, they will still gain recognition at your institution and faculty will come to expect them.",

Thus,\nthere are no additional modules or dynamism as\nwith MoE, making DUS immediately compatible\nwith easy-to-use LLM frameworks such as Hug-\ngingFace (Wolf et al., 2019) with no changes to\nthe training or inference framework for maximal\nefficiency. Furthermore, DUS is applicable to all\ntransformer architectures, opening up new gate-\nways to effectively and efficiently scale-up LLMs\nin a simple manner. Using DUS, we release SO-\nLAR 10.7B, an LLM with 10.7 billion parameters,\nthat outperforms existing models like Llama 2 (Tou-\nvron et al., 2023) and Mistral 7B (Jiang et al., 2023)\nin various benchmarks.",

Consequently, we set the rephrased question\nas the prompt and use the rephrased answer as the\nchosen response and the original answer as the re-\njected response and create the {prompt, chosen,\nrejected} DPO tuple. We aggregate the tuples from\nthe rephrased question-answer pairs and call the\nresulting dataset 'Synth. Math-Alignment'.",

The model's sig-\nnificant computational demands for training and\ninference might limit its use, especially for those\nwith restricted computational resources. Addition-\nally, like all machine learning models, it is vulnera-\nble to biases in its training data, which could lead\nto skewed outcomes in certain situations. Further-\nmore, the substantial energy consumption required\nfor training and operating the model raises environ-\nmental concerns, which are critical in the pursuit\nof sustainable AI development.",
