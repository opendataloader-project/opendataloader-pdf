scheme helped the biomass power capacity to increase by more than double in 7 years.
Under the FIT scheme, biomass fuels for power generation are grouped into six categories.

- · General wood: sawmill residues, import wood such as pellets and chips, palm kernel
shell (PKS) and palm trunk
· Liquid biomass: palm oil
· Unutilised wood: domestic thinned wood
· Construction wood waste: wood waste salvaged from construction and other wood
materials
· Waste materials and other biomass: pruned branched, paper, food waste, waste
cooking oil, and black liquor
· Biogas: methane derived from sewage sludge, manure, and food waste.

While inexpensive biomass sources such as wood waste from construction and waste
materials, were the main fuels under the RPS, the domestic unutilised wood and the
general wood whose tariff rates are set higher increased specifically (Figure 4.1, 4.2).

FIT = feed-in-tariff.
Note: Liquid biomass approved under the FIT scheme between FY2012 and FY2017 is included in general wood
and no liquid biomass has been approved since FY2018.
