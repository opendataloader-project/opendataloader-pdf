# Cellular Replication

# Growth and the Creation of Life

One of the characteristics of living things is the ability
to replicate and passon genetic information to the next
generation. Cell division in individual bacteria and
archaea usually occurs by binary fission. Mitochondria
and chloroplasts also replicate by binary fission, which
is evidence of the evolutionary relationship between
these organelles and prokaryotes.
Cell division in eukaryotes is more complex. It requires
the cell to manage acomplicated process of duplicating
the nucleus, other organelles, and multiple linear
chromosomes. It is controlled in the cell cycle, which is
divided into three parts: interphase, mitosis, and
cytokinesis. We spilt those further for ease of study.
Let's start with interphase, which is broken into three
stages. In the first growth phase (G1),the cell grows and
prepares to duplicate its DNA. In the synthesis phase
(S), the chromosomes are replicated. In the second
growth phase (G2), the cell prepares to divide.
