Another way to represent the two rates of return measures and their relationship to each other is to
represent them in a two dimensional scatter graph.

We may visually observe how the two sets of rates of return move together by drawing a line through
the points on the graph in such a way as to minimize the squared distance from the point to the line.
Our scatter graph is identified as Figure 15.3.

The relationship between the returns on the new investment and the firm's portfolio can be
expressed as:

(15.42)

r_t^j=a+\betar_t^j+\epsilon_t
