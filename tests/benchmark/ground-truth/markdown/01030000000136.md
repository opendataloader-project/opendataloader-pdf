Figure 10.2: Positive attributes reported by recreational anglers in the United States. Long description.

Over time, an angler's motivation may change from a catch orientation to emphasize noncatch motivations,
such as being outdoors or passing on their passion for fishing (McKenna 2013). The progression often follows
these stages:

- · Stage 1: I just want to catch a fish!
· Stage 2: I want to catch a lot of fish!
· Stage 3: I want to catch big fish.
· Stage 4: I'm just happy to be out fishing.
· Stage 5: I want to pass on my knowledge and passion for fishing.

Studies of angler characteristics confirm that there is no such thing as an "average" angler. Rather, anglers are
a heterogeneous and changing group. Therefore, we can segment anglers in distinct categories for analysis
(Bryan 1977; Kyle et al. 2007; Beardmore et al. 2013; TenHarmsel et al. 2019). For example, Magee (2018)
categorized recreational anglers into five distinct fisher classes with differing motivations (Table 10.1).
