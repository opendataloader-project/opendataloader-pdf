At Home in Exile

to speak, using half my allocated 20 minutes because he had a different
memory of our internment. As a young boy he had a wonderful time in
camp, getting up to mischief, playing games, feeling adventurous. Girls
are more vulnerable. Puberty can be a greater problem for them.

Another interesting matter associated with this book is that the Iranian-
born anthropologist Dr Pedram Khosronejad contacted me in 2019 after
reading my book in the house of a friend. Pandanus Press having ceased
to exist, Pedram took considerable trouble to locate and invite me to join
a small group for a project he was devising. Their parents had also been
interned from Persia during the period covered by my book. The group is
now aged between 64 and 85 years of age - the 'children of internees from
Persia'. The group works collectively and individually in association with
Dr Khosronejad's experiment of a reciprocal anthropology of the aged.
Outcomes of their work will include a publication as well as documentary
film. This book remains one of several unique contributions within the
development of the project.

With the literary title used in its initial hard copy, this book has not been
part of bibliographies on civilian or refugee internment in Australia,
although it is unusual as an account of a female's personal experiences.
