# COURSE MARKING DRIVERS

SB1359 was passed in September 2016, going into force in January 2018. The law "requires California
Community Colleges and California State Universities and requests the University of California
system to include a symbol/logo in the online campus course schedule by January 1, 2018 for courses
that exclusively use digital course materials that are free of charge to students and therefore not
required to be purchased."

The potential scale of impact is significant. With 114 colleges serving 2.1 million students, the
California Community Colleges (CCCs) comprise the largest public system of higher education in the
US. The California State University (CSU) with 23 campuses serving nearly 500,000 students, is the
largest four-year public university system in the US. Notably, the law does not apply to the state's
research-focused University of California.

# IMPLEMENTATION

Between the passage of the law in 2016 and the implementation of the law in 2018, both the CCCs
and CSU systems engaged in outreach to the field. The CCCs' system office issued a memo to college
leadership explaining the requirements and created a sample logo that colleges could choose to adopt.
The CSU system's Affordable Learning Solutions team engaged the field with a series of webinars and
FAQs.
