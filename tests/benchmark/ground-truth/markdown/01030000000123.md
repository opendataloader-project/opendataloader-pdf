The underlying raw data went through many stages before it
was presented to you in this data visualization. The information
had to be:

- · Collected via surveys
· Inputted into a database
· Stored on secure servers
· Cleaned for accuracy and consistency
· Analyzed to understand the trends
· Presented as a bar graph
