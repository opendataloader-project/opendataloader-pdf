15.5 MJ/kg; PKS: 18 MJ/kg; Construction wood waste, Other waste, and Others: assuming the same with wood
pellets.

According to Japan's trade statistics, its import of wood pellets has increased around 16
times from 2014 to 2019. Viet Nam and Canada are the largest suppliers of Japan's wood
pellet imports (Figure 4.7). On the other hand, domestic wood pellet production stayed
almost the same over the same period (Figure 4.8).
