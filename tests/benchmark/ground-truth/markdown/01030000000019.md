# Author's Note to the
2021 Edition

This book is a minimally amended, reprinted version of Sing me that
lovely song again (Pandanus Press, 2006). The title was chosen by Ian
Templeman, the publisher, because he was more interested in its literary
merits than in academic history. For that reason, many of my dates were
removed from the original manuscript during editing.

My original intention was to get my parents and the elder of my two
brothers to write their own memories of how they experienced their
internment in Persia and five years behind barbed wire in Australia
during World War II, focusing on individual memory by gender and age.
It seemed a remarkable opportunity to make this anecdotal and analytical
contribution to social science: they had each lived in the same space with
the same people for the same period. It was to be an experiment made in
heaven, that is, within an impeccable laboratory. But my parents had been
too distressed by their loss of freedom and the congested and pressured
atmosphere of life in camp to collaborate.

Because I wanted to keep the focus on my own memories, and the tone
of voice my own, I wrote my own book with only minimal research in
various archives in Australia and abroad. I did some research as a check on
some important facts.

Asked to speak about my book at an academic conference at the
University of Queensland in 2006, I did some further research to validate
my contribution. My speech was then published in National Socialism in
Oceania (edited by Emily Turner-Graham and Christine Winter, Peter
Lang, 2010) with the title I had originally suggested to Pandanus Press,
'At Home in Exile: Ambiguities of wartime patriotism'. When in 2015
I was asked by Japanese scholars to speak at Cowra, NSW, at a conference
on internment, I suggested that my younger brother, Peter, also be invited
