# Closure

Closure refers to our mind completing missing portions of a
design. There must be enough parts available for the image
to be "filled in"; if the image is too abstract, there are minimal
reference points for the mind to complete it. See Figure 4.44
for an example of how our mind automatically imagine a line
connecting the 2 broken ones.
