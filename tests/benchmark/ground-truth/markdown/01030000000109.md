the jet velocity can be assumed to remain constant. Therefore, the horizontal distance traveled by jet
(x) in time (t) is equal to:

x=v.t

(7)

The vertical component of the trajectory of the jet will have a constant acceleration downward due to
the force of gravity. Therefore, at any time, t, the y-position of the jet may be calculated as:

y=\frac{1}{2}gt^2

(8)

Rearranging Equation (8) gives:

t=\left(\frac{2y}{g}\right)^{0.5}

(9)

Substitution of t and v from Equations 9 and 2 into Equation 7 results in:

x=C_v\sqrt{2gh}\left(\frac{2y}{g}\right)^{0.5}

(10)

Equations (10) can be rearranged to find Cv:

C_v=\frac{x}{2\sqrt{yh}}

(11)

Therefore, for steady flow conditions (i.e., constant h in the head tank), the value of Cv can be
determined from the x, y coordinates of the jet trajectory. A graph of x plotted against √yh will have
a slope of 2Cv.

# 7.2. DETERMINATION OF THE COEFFICIENT OF DISCHARGE

If Cd is assumed to be constant, then a graph of Q plotted against √h (Equation 6) will be linear, and
the slope of this graph will be:

s=C_dA_o\sqrt{2g}
