In this content, DPN Argentina provides a brief explanation of the SDGs and
the 2030 Agenda action plans, and most importantly, their role in advancing the 2030
Agenda through the SDGs Monitoring and Evaluation Program with a focus on certain
thematic areas. These focuses allow DPN Argentina to investigate through monitoring
and preparing reports on the development of public policies and actions of
organizations responsible for compliance with the SDGs, as well as proposals, and
recommendations to strengthen related processes.

Furthermore, DPN Argentina also regularly uploads commemorations of
days related to the SDGs by also including the SDGs logo in each of these uploads.
Examples of such greetings are as follows:
