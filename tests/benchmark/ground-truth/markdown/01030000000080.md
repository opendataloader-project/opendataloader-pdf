# III. Regulatory cholesterol

This report defines
'regulatory cholesterol'
as the policy actions of
the three arms of the State, i.e. the
executive, the legislature, and the
judiciary, using the instruments of
legislations, rules, regulations or
orders, to create or raise barriers to
a smooth flow of ideas, organisation,
money and most importantly, the flow
of the entrepreneurial spirit. In India,
a wrong political choice in the early
decades of Independence has created a
policy fraternity that shuns data and
causalities and leans on rhetoric and
ideologies to frame economic policies.
Inflation in the 1970s, for instance, was
not caused by hoarders and speculators;
it was a matter of supply and demand.
"Excoriating, coercing, or imprisoning
the hoarders and speculators changes
nothing in terms of creating new
supply," write Vijay Kelkar and Ajay
Shah.28 "The economic theory of people
hostile to economic forces is wrong."

By taking one policy tool -
imprisonment - this report highlights
the excesses of overregulation and
the resultant regulatory cholesterol
while doing business in India.
Although the biggest constituency
at the receiving end of these laws
is that of entrepreneurs running for-
profit firms and corporations, this
regulatory overreach also impacts
not-for-profits such as schools and
hospitals-both necessary institutions
for India with a huge demand. Step
