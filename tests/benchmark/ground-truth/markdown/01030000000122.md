- 3. Mix reagents by pipetting gently up and down.

- 4. Incubate all of the reaction tubes for 1 hour at 37 °C.

NOTE: Your instructor will freeze your completed restriction digests at -20 °C until the next lab period.

# III. Electrophorese Digests

Reagents:

- · Restriction digests from Part II, on ice
· 10× loading dye, 10 𝜇L

Supplies and Equipment

- · Gel electrophoresis chamber with agarose gel in gel tray, power supply
· 1-20 𝜇L Micropipette and pipet tips

# Load the Gel

1. Use a micropipette to add 2 𝜇L of 10× loading dye to a reaction tube. Use the pipet tip and gently pipet up
and down a couple of times to mix the 10× loading dye with the digested DNA. Use a new pipet tip and repeat
for each digest.

2. Use a micropipette to load the contents of each reaction tube (20 𝜇L total) into a separate well in the gel.
Use a fresh pipet tip for each reaction tube and write down the order in which the samples are loaded.

NOTE: Be careful not to punch the tip of the pipet through the bottom or side of the well.

While loading,

- · steady the pipet over the well using two hands. You may wish to place one or both elbows on
the lab bench to steady your hands.
· be careful to expel any air in the pipet tip end before loading the gel. If an air bubble forms a
cap over the well, the sample will flow into the buffer around the edges of the well.
